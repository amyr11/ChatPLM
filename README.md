ChatPLM is a chatbot trained on PLM data for university-specific information queries. It consists of a neural network trained on PLM-specific data to identify the patterns of user prompts and provide the appropriate response. Using NLP techniques, ChatPLM is able to understand the context of the user's prompts.

`note:` This version is still under development. The model might answer inaccurately because of limited training data.
